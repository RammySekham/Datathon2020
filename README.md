# Datathon2020
This repo contains raw datasets, 
data enrichment(code), 
Exploratory data analysis (EDA code), 
Statistical Modelling(Forecast code), 
data visualization and dashboard link for electricity consumption in Australia before and after Covid 19.

To run this repository on your system, please follow below steps.

1. Go through datasources.md file to understand the context of the problem statement and data sources
2. Make a copy of Codes and datasources folders on your system (Datasources folder contains a zip file of raw_datasets and codes folder contains 4 codes for each step 
of data analysis in data sciences : Data Curation, Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA), Data Visualization, Statistical Modelling
3. Make 'CuratedDatasets' a empty folder , place it with other two folders, to recieve modified files.
4. Change the link(link of folder in each code i.e D:\PythonLearn\Datathon2020)
5. Run code in sequence : Convert_raw_toFiles, EDA, Data Visualization, Model
6. You can also build visualization as such :https://public.tableau.com/profile/raman4374#!/vizhome/ElectricityConsumption_Australia/ElectricityConsumption
